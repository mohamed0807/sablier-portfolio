                  Setting up a payment stream is simple! Here's what you need:
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Sepolia ERC20 Token</strong> and{" "}
                      <strong>ETH</strong> (for transaction fees) in your
                      wallet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Sender</strong>: The person who owes the debt.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Token Address</strong>: The ERC20 token you want
                      to send as payment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Recipient</strong>: The person who will receive
                      the debt payments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Amount</strong>: The total debt amount to be paid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Rate Per Second</strong>: The rate at which the
                      recipient will collect the debt. For example, if user A
                      wants to pay 10 USDC per day to user B, the rate per
                      second will be calculated as:
                      <br />
                      <code>
                        Rate per second = 10 USDC / 86400 seconds =
                        0.00011574074 USDC per second
                      </code>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  No need to approve the contract for your tokenâ€”our platform
                  handles it for you. Plus, there's no upfront deposit required!

                <div>
                  Add funds to your stream to start transferring payments to the
                  recipient. The funds will be transferred continuously based on
                  the set RPS.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For example: you never have to worry about depositing more
                  funds than you owe per day, because the recipient can only
                  withdraw what they are owed per day.
                </div>
              }

                <div>
                  Modify the Rate Per Second (RPS) to increase or decrease the
                  speed of payments at any point during the stream.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Note:</strong> This will determine how much the
                  recipient can collect from their debt payment per day.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For example, if you set the Rate Per Second to 1 USDC, then
                  the recipient will be able to collect 86400 (1 day in seconds)
                  USDC per day.
